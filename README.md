_Some Package Manager Written in Python_

This is a (universal?) package manager that is currently in developement. It is currently being designed to act as wrapper for the basic autotools commands. It will also be written in (_hopefully_) pure python, and have very few dependencies.


### Dependencies

The only dependencies so far are:
+ Python 3 (_obviously_)
+ click, a Python CLI module (You can find it [here](http://click.pocoo.org/6/).)
